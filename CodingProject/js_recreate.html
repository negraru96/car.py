          <p id="first">Javascript Basics</p>
          <p id="second">Javascipt is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely
            popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for
            developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.Javascript lives inside a bost environment (a web
            browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic
            control over them.</p>
          <p id="third"><span class="Vdec">Variable Declaration</span> Javascript variables are containers for storing
            data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All
            Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called
            identifiers. <span class="varx">var x;</span></p>
          <p id="fourth"><span class="Vdec">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to
            Javascript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.
            The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="varx">var x = 10;</span></p>
          <p id="fifth"><span class="Vdec">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to
            operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are Javascript
            primitives: Boolean - <span class="varx">true</span> or <span class="varx">false;</span> null - <span class="varx">null</span> aka
            nothing; Number - <span class="varx">42</span> or <span class="varx">3.14159;</span>
            String - <span class="varx">Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="varx">[1, 'Coding',2,'Dojo']</span>;
            and Object - <span class="varx">{first_name: 'Jane',last_name: 'Doe'}</span></p>
          <p id="sixth"><span class="Vdec">Conditionals</span> When you write a code, you want to perform different
            actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have
            been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following
            conditional statements: <span class="varx">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our
            code block; <span class="varx">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition
            is false; <span class="varx">else</span> we execute this block of code;</p>
          <p id="seventh"><span class="Vdec">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming
            language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times.
            Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a
            loop!</p>
          <p id="eighth"><span class="Vdec">Function</span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block.
            When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As
            an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and
            get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up.
            Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function
            over and over and over again.</p>
