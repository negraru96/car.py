      <p id="wigblocktxt">What is Git?</p>
      <p id="wigblocktxt1">Git is a version control <br />
        system; you can think of it <br />
        as a series of snapshots <br />
        (commits) of your code base. <br />
        With the creation of each <br />
        snapshot you build out a <br />
        whole application, seeing <br />
        the growth of a full app. <br />
        During this time you can <br />
        make branches to experiment <br />
        and come back to a previous <br />
        snapshot you took or merge <br />
        those experiments into your <br />
        app.</p>
      <p id="wigblocktxt2">What is GitHub?</p>
      <p id="wigblocktxt3">GitHub is a code hosting <br />
        platform for version control <br />
        and collaboration. It lets <br />
        you and others wprk together <br/>
        on projects from anywhere <br />
        using those code snapshots <br />
        that you took during <br />
        development.</p>
      <div id="giblock"></div>
        <p id="giblocktxt">Git init</p>
        <p id="giblocktxtb"><span class="gicyan">Git init</span> is the <br />
          act of <br />
          registering this <br />
          current code <br />
          base.</p>
      <div id="gablock"></div>
        <p id="gablocktxt">Git add</p>
        <p id="gablocktxtb"><span class="gicyan">Git add</span> is how we <br />
          stage the <br />
          integration of <br />
          our current code <br />
          base into our <br />
          current list of <br />
          snapshots.</p>
      <div id="gsblock"></div>
        <p id="gsblocktxt">Git status</p>
        <p id="gsblocktxtb"><span class="gicyan">Git status</span> allows <br />
          us to see the <br />
          changes we are <br />
          going to make.</p>
        <div id="gcblock"></div>
          <p id="gcblocktxt">Git commit</p>
          <p id="gcblocktxtb"><span class="gicyan">Git commit;</span> finally we can <br />
            commit those changes we added <br />
            to our last snapshot giving us <br />
            a new snapshot of our code with <br />
            whatever new changes were made.</p>
          <div id="grablock"></div>
            <p id="grablocktxt">Git remote add</p>
            <p id="grablocktxtb"><span class="gicyan">Git remote add</span> is used to set <br />
              up a online repository where we <br />
              can place all of our current <br />
              code. This is where the outside <br />
              world can see our code base.</p>
          <div id="gpblock"></div>
              <p id="gpblocktxt">Git push</p>
              <p id="gpblocktxtb"><span class="gicyan">Git push</span> is how we get our code to Github, an excellent place to store <br />
                all of our repositories. Other developers might look at our existing <br />
                projects to see how we approached problems, pull down our code and add <br />
                new features or even update our code base with features they wanted to <br />
                add.
